## **E-commerce Customer Conversion Prediction**

**Problem Statement**

We have an E-commerce dataset and our goal is to predict whether a visitor will convert into a customer or not. The dataset contains various features, and the target variable we are interested in is the "has_converted" column. We will perform classification to determine whether a user will convert into a customer or not.

**Introduction :**

A dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, statistical analysis, feature selection, and model building. We will also make predictions for live stream data and display the precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score for three different models.

We start by importing the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, and scikit-learn modules for data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## **Key Concepts**

***Reading the dataset             :*** 
We need to read the dataset using the pd.read_csv() function, providing the URL of the dataset.

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :***
Perform multiple EDA with plots and  other visualization  using  Streamlit.
We can use it to create visualizations, display data, and perform various analysis tasks in detail .

***Preprocessing :***
After performing EDA, we move on to preprocessing the data. This step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and other necessary preprocessing steps.

***Statistical Analysis :***
We next perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the data, such as calculating descriptive statistics or performing hypothesis testing or conducting other statistical tests.

***Feature Selection :***
Feature selection is an important step in model building. It involves selecting the most relevant features for the classification task. One common technique is to use the SelectKBest method, it is important to scale the features using the StandardScaler to ensure all features have the same scale.

***Train-Test Split :***
Before training the models, We split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn.

***Model Building :***
We build  3 models using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest.These models will be used for prediction and evaluation.

***Model Evaluation :***
After training the models, we evaluate their performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are performing.

***Live Stream Data Prediction :***
Once the models are trained and evaluated, we can use them to make predictions on live stream data. This allows us to predict whether a customer will convert or not in real-time.

***Display Model Metrics :***
Finally, we calculate the precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score for each model. Display the results using Streamlit.

## **Image Pre-processing and OCR using OpenCV in Python**

**Introduction**

In this, we will explore how to perform image pre-processing and optical character recognition (OCR) using the OpenCV library in Python. Image pre-processing involves applying various transformations to an image to enhance its quality and extract useful information. OCR is the process of extracting text from images.

## **Key Concepts**

***Image Pre-processing:*** In image processing, pre-processing plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of images and extracting useful information. It involves a series of steps to prepare the image for further analysis or manipulation.

***Reading the Image:*** The code starts by reading an image.

***Grayscale Conversion:*** Converting an image to grayscale reduces the image to shades of gray, removing color information. This simplifies the image and makes it easier to analyze.

***Inverting:*** Inverting an image involves reversing the intensity values of each pixel. This can be useful in certain applications, such as enhancing the visibility of certain features.

***HSV Conversion:*** HSV stands for Hue, Saturation, and Value. Converting an image to HSV color space allows us to manipulate the color information more effectively.

***Rotation:*** Rotating an image involves changing its orientation by a certain angle. This can be useful for correcting the alignment of images or extracting specific features.

***Noise Reduction:*** Noise in an image can degrade its quality and affect subsequent analysis. Techniques like Gaussian blur, median filtering, and bilateral filtering can be used to reduce noise and smoothen the image.

***Dilation and Erosion:*** These morphological operations are used to modify the shape and size of objects in an image. Dilation expands the boundaries of objects, while erosion shrinks them.

***Thresholding:*** Thresholding is a technique used to convert a grayscale image into a binary image by dividing the pixels into foreground and background based on a certain threshold value.

***Edge Detection:*** Edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detection, identify the boundaries between different objects or regions in an image.

***OCR:*** Optical Character Recognition is a technology that recognizes and extracts text from images or scanned documents. It is widely used in applications like document digitization, text extraction, and automated data entry. Using  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides various functions and algorithms for image and video processing. If you have an image containing text, you can uncomment the code section related to OCR. It reads the text image using performs OCR using the OpenCV function and prints the extracted text.

## **NLP Processing : Text Pre-processing, Keyword Extraction, and Sentiment Analysis**

**Introduction**
In this Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python. NLP is a field of study that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves various tasks such as text pre-processing, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis. 

## **Key Concepts**

**Text Pre-processing** It involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format suitable for analysis. 

***Lowercasing :*** Converting all text to lowercase ensures that the model treats words with different cases as the same.

***Tokenization :*** Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. It helps in breaking down the text into smaller units for analysis.

***Stemming :*** Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. It removes suffixes and prefixes to obtain the core meaning of a word. 

***Lemmatization :*** Lemmatization is similar to stemming but aims to obtain the base form of a word using vocabulary and morphological analysis. It considers the context of the word and produces a valid word that makes sense. 

***Stopword Removal :*** Stopwords are common words that do not carry much meaning. 

***Part of speech tagging :*** We use the NLTK library to perform part of speech tagging on a given text. This involves tokenizing the text into individual words and then assigning POS tags to each word.

***N-gram analysis :*** We define a function to extract N-grams from a given text. The function takes the text and the value of N as input and returns a list of N-grams.

***Word cloud generation :*** We create a word cloud using the wordcloud library. The word cloud is generated based on the frequency of words in the given text.

**Keyword Extraction:** It is the process of identifying important words or phrases from a given text. Keywords can provide insights into the main topics or themes present in the pre-processed text. It checks if each token is present in a predefined list of keywords and stores the matching tokens in a separate variable.

**Sentiment Analysis:** It aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text. It can be used to analyze customer reviews, social media sentiment, or any text that expresses an opinion.on the processed text using the TextBlob library. It calculates the sentiment polarity and subjectivity of the text and Display the result.

**Introduction**

In this we will explore how to build a product recommendation system using Python. A recommendation system is a powerful tool that suggests relevant products to users based on their preferences and behavior. By implementing a recommendation algorithm, we can provide personalized recommendations to users, enhancing their shopping experience and increasing sales.

## **Key Concepts**

***Content-Based Filtering:*** This approach recommends products based on the attributes or characteristics of the products themselves. It analyzes the features of the products and suggests similar items to the ones the user has already shown interest in.

It consists of a function called get_recommendations that takes a user's selected product as input. The get_recommendations function takes a user's selected product as an argument. Inside the function, you can implement your recommendation algorithm.which returns a list of recommended products. Finally, the recommended products are displayed to the user.
